              (including the Storage Services). The Storj Labs Terms of Use and

              <p><b>2. Overview of Storage Platform</b></p>

              <p>The Storage Services enable you to store data and other
              materials (&ldquo;<b>Storage Materials</b>&rdquo;) via a
              distributed network of third-party devices (&ldquo;<b>Storage
              Nodes</b>&rdquo;) that comprise the Storage Platform. The Storage
              Platform is an interconnected set of Storage Nodes that
              independently operate open source software to facilitate the
              storage of your Storage Materials. The Storage Services are
              designed to encrypt Storage Materials locally on your device and
              then facilitate the distribution of such encrypted data fragments
              to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and Storage Nodes are
              not operated or maintained by Company, and Company has no
              responsibility or liability for the Storage Platform or Storage
              Nodes. The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss of
              your Storage Materials due to the failure of any individual
              Storage Node by allowing you to configure the redundancy and
              distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible
              for your use of the Storage Platform, including for configurations
              that you deem appropriate to maintain access to your Storage
              Materials in a manner that meets your expectations.
              </p>

              <p><b>3. Account</b></p>

              <p>In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register
              for an account (&ldquo;<b>Account</b>&rdquo;). In connection with
              your creation of any Account, you will (i) provide accurate,
              current and complete Account information, (ii) maintain and
              promptly update your Account information as necessary, (iii)
              maintain the security of your Account, including by not using the
              same password for the Storage Services that you use for
              third-party services, (iv) not disclose your password or private
              keys to any third party, and (v) immediately notify us if you
              discover or otherwise suspect any unauthorized activities in
              connection with your Account or the Storage Services. You
              acknowledge and agree that if you lose your private keys, you may
              not be able to recover any Storage Materials.
              </p>

              <p><b>4. Payment</b></p>

              <p>(a) We will provide notice via the Storage Services of the fees
              applicable to use of the Storage Services
              (&quot;<b>Fees</b>&quot;). All Fees are exclusive of any
              applicable taxes, unless stated otherwise, which are your sole
              responsibility. We will provide notice at least 30 days in advance
              of any increase to the Fees.
              </p>

              <p>(b)<b></b>Except where otherwise indicated via the Storage
              Services, we will charge all Fees to a payment method designated
              by you via the Storage Services that is acceptable to us. You
              represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment
              method you designate via the Storage Services and authorize us to
              charge all Fees to that method. If your payment method cannot be
              verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right
              to use the Storage Services may be suspended automatically. Fees
              will be charged on a monthly basis based on the prior
              month&rsquo;s usage. You can avoid incurring Fees at any time by
              discontinuing your use of the Storage Services to store your
              Storage Materials.
              </p>

              <p>(c) Except as prohibited by law, we may assess a late charge if
              you do not pay Fees on time. The late charge will be the lesser
              of 1.5 % of the unpaid amount each month or the maximum rate
              permitted by law. You are responsible for all costs we incur to
              collect any past due amounts, including reasonable attorneys&#39;
              fees and other legal fees and costs. We may suspend your access to
              the Storage Services immediately without notice if you fail to pay
              Fees on time.

              for backing up any Storage Materials.<b> </b></p>

              <p>(c) You are responsible for properly configuring and using the
              Storage Services to store your Storage Materials via the Storage
              Platform, and for maintaining appropriate security of your Storage
              Materials, which may include the use of encryption. We reserve the
              right at any time, without notice, to remove, reject or delete any

              </p>

              <p>(d) You are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing
              of Storage Materials via the Storage Services is in compliance
              with all applicable laws. We make no representations or warranties
              regarding the suitability of the Storage Services for the

              You will provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from,
              third parties as required by applicable law in connection with the

              <p><b>6. Effect of Suspension or Termination</b></p>

              <p>If your access to the Storage Services is suspended or
              terminated, you will no longer have access to the Storage
              Materials processed via the Storage Services for storage in the
              Storage Platform, and your Storage Materials may not be
              recoverable.  If we terminate or suspend your access to the
              Storage Services for reasons other than your breach of the
              Agreement, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide
              you an opportunity to retrieve your Storage Materials via the
              Storage Services.
              </p>

              <p><b>7. SLA</b></p>

              <p>(a) Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet
              the following service level commitment (&ldquo;<b>SLA</b>&rdquo;):
              except for scheduled maintenance, our Storage Services will be
              available 99.99999% of the time. We calculate availability based
              upon the service records we maintain. We will use reasonable
              efforts to notify you in advance of any scheduled maintenance.
              </p>

              <p>(b) Our SLA obligations do not extend to any unavailability of
              the Storage Services that is caused by: (i) any hardware or
              software that you use in connection with the Storage Services;
              (ii) misuse of our Storage Services or the Storage Platform,
              including use in breach of the Agreement or use other than in
              accordance with any documentation or other instructions provided
              by Company; (iii) circumstances or events beyond the reasonable
              control of Company; or (iv) our suspension or termination of your
              access to the Storage Services pursuant to the rights we have
              reserved under the Agreement.
              </p>

              <p>(c) As the sole and exclusive remedy for our breach of the SLA,
              Company will provide a credit against Fees payable to Company (&ldquo;<b>Credits</b>&rdquo;) in the following amounts: (i)
              if availability during any calendar month is less than 99.99999%
              but above 99.0%, then we will provide a Credit of 10% of the
              monthly Fees actually paid during that month; and (ii) if
              availability during any calendar month is less than 99.0%, then we
              will provide a Credit of 20% of the monthly Fees actually paid
              during that month.
              </p>

              <p>(d) You will only be eligible to receive Credits if you have
              paid all Fees on time, are not past due on any payments, and
              notify us of a request for Credits within 30 days of the end of
              the calendar month in which we have not met our SLA. We will issue
              Credits solely as an offset against future Fees that are payable
              by you to Company. You will not be entitled to a refund or other
              payment from Company in connection with any Credits you accrue. In
              no event will the total amount of Credits exceed 20% of the Fees
              payable by you for the corresponding month.
              </p>

              <p><b>8. Promotional Credits</b></p>

              <p>(a) The Company may also provide credits against fees payable to the company in relation to marketing, referrals, or other events ("Promotional Credits"). All credits not deemed to be Service Credits will be considered Promotional Credits.
              </p>
              <p>(b) Promotional Credits must be redeemed within 12 months of issuance unless otherwise stated.
              </p>
              <p>(c) After redemption, Promotional Credits are valid for a period of 12 months. Promotional Credits that have not been used at that time will expire.
